# NoHiHello

A GitHub Pages site inspired by [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/en/) — encouraging teammates to send their full message on **Microsoft Teams** instead of just "Hi" or "Hello" and waiting.

## Features

- Retro console/monospace font styling with scanline overlay
- Classic marquee banner
- Animated SVG robot asking users to send proper messages
- Side-by-side bad vs. good chat examples
- Fully responsive, single-page, no dependencies

2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set source to **main** branch, root (`/`).
4. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/NoHiHello/`.
